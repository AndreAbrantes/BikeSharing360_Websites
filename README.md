Keynote's MultiContainer Demo
-----------------------------

The solution _BikeSharing360.sln_ contains the MultiContainer Demo shown by Donovan Brown. It is a multicontainer solution that contains various netcore projects.

You can run the solution under Docker using the "Dcker: Debug Solution" in VS2107. All projects in the solution will run under Docker, and debug still works as usual.
